We are happy to announce the release of TiGL 3.2.2. 

Although it is a bugfix release, TiGL 3.2.2 comes with the support of canard style flaps.
This is a minor modification of the trailing edge device definition, that allows
to position the hinge points of the flaps outside of the wing via an optional
translation vector. In addition, a trailing edge device is now allowed to also
include the leading edge such that canards can be made possible.

TiGL 3.2.2 fixes the following issues:

 - CPACS versions headers could not been correctly parsed, if the version number contained a patch version (issue #830). This is now fixed. TiGL now is able to support semantic versioning.
 - Fixed multiple errors that occured during the computation of wing cells (issues #815, #829, #840).
 - Fixed computation of the wing aspect ratio (issue #827). For the computation, the wing cord face has to be projected onto a reference plane according to the definition.
   We added a heuristic that figures out, which reference plane to choose.
 - Fixed multiple crashes in TiGL Viewer when displaying control surface devices, in particular if they were defined incorrectly (issue #851).
 - Improved robustness of export functions. The export now tries to export as much as possible, even if one component failed to built (issue #853).
 
 For the python bindings, we also addresses the following issues:

  - Added tigl3 conda packages for python 3.9.
  - Fixed loading python bindings with python 3.8 due to a changed DLL loading policy (issue #842).
  - Fixed a crash in the python bindings due to wrong memory handling (issue #823).
