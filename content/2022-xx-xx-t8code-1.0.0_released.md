After spending a long time in a pre-release status we are releasing the first major version of t8code. With this version, we present a parallel adaptiv mesh library supporty hybrid meshes. t8codes minimal and efficient approach to store and manage meshes already enabled benchmark-examples to use up to one million MPI-processes and over one trillion mesh elements. 

Naturally, we are not finished developping t8code. If you have observed our repository over the last years, you have notices a lot of progress in our code. We will keep on developping, enhancing and integrating new features into t8code, keeping t8code on track with recent development in High-Performance-Computing and requirements on mesh-libraries.
