We are finally releasing the <a href="https://github.com/DLR-AMR/t8code">first major version of t8code, v1.0</a>. t8code is a parallel adaptive mesh management library with support for hybrid meshes.
t8code uses the efficient space-filling curve approach to store and manage meshes and extends it to all common element shapes.
We have demonstrated its efficiency and scalability on a variety of clusters and supercomputes and have shown t8code's capacity to handle up to one million parallel processes and over one trillion mesh elements.

If your application needs fast, efficient and scalable mesh management, try t8code!

The journey continues. We will keep on developing, enhancing and integrating new features into t8code, keeping t8code on track with recent development in High-Performance-Computing and requirements on mesh-libraries.
