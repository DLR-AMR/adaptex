The TiGL website is online. We decided to host this website for the TiGL Library to keep
in touch with the users. The Github repository alone works fine for hosting our code,
but it lacks a way to add more information, documentation etc. 

The website - once it is finished - should 

 * Inform on new Releases.
 * Inform on current developments with blog posts.
 * Be a central information page for the users.
 * Provide tutorials and the documentation.
 
 We will also create a mailing list as a next step, where users can join to be informed about the latest news.
