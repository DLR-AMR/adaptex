									Something about data reduction
								</h2>
								<p>Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen.</p>
                                <p>We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. That easy. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow.</p>
                                <p>This is truly an almighty mountain. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. Anyone can paint.</p>

									Our submissions to the International Meshing Roundtable (IMR) 2022
								</h2>
								<p>
									The International Meshing Roundtable 2022 was held as part of the SIAM Conference on Parallel Processing for Scientific Computing 2022 (PP22). Following their call for entries to the meshing contest IMR, we constructed this mesh of the famous Seattle Space Needle. Our submission demonstrates the capability of t8code to manage very large hybrid meshes. 
								</p>
								<p>
									The mesh representing the Space Needle is embedded into a cubic mesh made out of all supported 3D mesh elements (hex, tets, prisms and pyramids). 
								</p>
								<p>
									Every element of the cubic mesh that intersects a line of the Space Needle mesh is refined - producing 81 million elements in 11.6 seconds on 56 cores.  The mesh also visualizes the huge difference in size that elements can have. On the coarsest level the elements have a diameter of up to 10m while the finest level divides the elements into elements that are 2cm small. 
								</p>

									Something about Juwels
								</h2>
								<p>If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. We'll throw some happy little limbs on this tree. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. There it is. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there.</p>
                                <p>Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it.</p>
                                <p>I like to beat the brush. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul.</p>

									Something about t8dg
								</h2>
								<p>Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. Let's get crazy. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky.</p>
                                <p>Just beat the devil out of it. There he comes. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it.</p>
                                <p>You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. Son of a gun. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse.</p>
