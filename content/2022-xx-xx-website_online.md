This is a fantastic little painting. Work that paint. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it.

Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. This piece of canvas is your world. Let's make a happy little mountain now. There we go. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. Without washing the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of Sap Green. It all happens automatically. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see.
