We are on track for exascale earth-system-modelling! Our ADAPTEX project team had a successful and productive semiannual meeting on Wednesday, Dezember 6.

Among other topics we discussed our GPU strategy and how we can leverage the first European exascale computer [JUPITER](https://www.fz-juelich.de/de/ias/jsc/jupiter) at 
[Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich]([200~https://www.fz-juelich.de/). 
The framework is coming together and we are designing first test cases now.
