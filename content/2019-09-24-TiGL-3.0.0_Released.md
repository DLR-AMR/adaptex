After more than a year of development, we finally released TiGL 3.0.
TiGL 3 is the first release that is compatible with the CPACS 3 standard.


TiGL 3 contains many changes, but the most important ones are:

 - CPACS 3 compatibility. TiGL will now be able to read CPACS 3 files. TiGL 3 is not backwards compatible.
   To process CPACS 2 files, please use the TiGL 2 releases. We encourage all our users, to switch to CPACS 3
   as it fixes many problematic parametrizations and definitions, that finally lead to problems in TiGL and other software.
   To convert your CPACS files, you can use our tool ``cpacs2to3``.
 - Change of the wing component segment definition. This new definition fixes the problem, that some of the wing component segment
   coordinates don't have a corresponding point on the wing surface.
 - Change of the wing structural definition and improved modeling of it. Please have a look on [our blog post](finishing-the-cpacs-3-wing-structure-implementation.html) for more information.
 - Modeling of the fuselage structure, nacelles and pylons.
 - Deleted deprecated functions, such as the old intersection API.
 - Improved modeling algorithms.
 
Compared with the TiGL 3.0.0-rc2 release candidate, only minor bug fixes have been added:
 
 - The function ```tiglSetDebugDataDirectory```, to set the output directory of debugging data.
 - Bugfix in ```tiglWingGetWettedArea```
 - Smaller compiler fixes with new OpenCASCADE versions
